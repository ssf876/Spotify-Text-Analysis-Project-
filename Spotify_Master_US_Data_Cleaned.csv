1,1,"Shape of You","Ed Sheeran",2017,3056912867,"The club isn't the best place to find a lover 
So the bar is where I go 
Me and my friends at the table doing shots 
Drinking fast and then we talk slow 
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me 
And trust me I'll give it a chance now 
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox 
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like 
Girl, you know I want your love 
Your love was handmade for somebody like me 
Come on now, follow my lead 
I may be crazy, don't mind me 
Say, boy, let's not talk too much 
Grab on my waist and put that body on me 
Come on now, follow my lead 
Come, come on now, follow my lead  
I'm in love with the shape of you 
We push and pull like a magnet do 
Although my heart is falling too 
I'm in love with your body 
And last night you were in my room 
And now my bedsheets smell like you 
Every day discovering something brand new 
I'm in love with your body 
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I 
I'm in love with your body 
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I 
I'm in love with your body 
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I 
I'm in love with your body 
Every day discovering something brand new 
I'm in love with the shape of you 
One week in we let the story begin 
We're going out on our first date 
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat 
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate 
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour 
And how your family is doing okay 
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat 
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like 
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much

2,2,"Symphony ","Clean Bandit",2017,1090994842,"I've been hearing symphonies
Before all I heard was silence
A rhapsody for you and me
And every melody is timeless
Life was stringing me along
Then you came and you cut me loose
Was solo singing on my own
Now I can't find the key without you
And now your song is on repeat
And I'm dancin' on to your heartbeat
And when you're gone, I feel incomplete
So if you want the truth
I just wanna be part of your symphony
Will you hold me tight and not let go?

Will you hold me tight and not let go?

But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to C√®ilidh singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sang so sweet
A capella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man

I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

Soft as the cuts on you lying

Used to talk 'til the morning

We had that mixtape on every weekend
Had it repeating

You were my September song
Tell me where have you gone?
Do you remember me?

And I, I remember the chorus
They were singing it for us
You were my September song
Tell me where have you gone?
Do you remember me?
We were only 15
Sometimes I think that I see your
Face in the strangest of places
Down on the underground station passing by
I get a mad sense of danger
Feel like my heart couldn't take it
Cause if we met we'd be strangers

Long as I can remember, never really knowing why
I wish I could be the perfect daughter
But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try
Every turn I take, every trail I track
Every path I make, every road leads back
To the place I know, where I can not go
Though I long to be
See the line where the sky meets the sea? it calls me
And no one knows how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know
If I go, there's just no telling how far I'll go

Seems so happy on this island
Everything is by design
I know everybody on this island
Has a role on this island
So maybe I can roll with mine
I can lead with pride, I can make us strong
I'll be satisfied if I play along
But the voice inside sings a different song
What is wrong with me?
See the light as it shines on the sea, it's blinding
But no one knows how deep it goes
And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me
And let me know what's beyond that line
Will I cross that line?
See the line where the sky meets the sea, it calls me
And no one knows how far it goes

I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long
I know I've grown, but I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and
Getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night
I don't reckon that I did it right, but
I was younger then, take me back to when
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long
Oh, how we've grown, but I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids, but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by, but
These people raised me
And I can't wait to go home
And I'm on my way
I still remember these old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Yo ya no creo que vuelva y te d√©
Mami, porque el servicio te lo cancel√©

Si no respondo, el problema va a tocar fondo
Mami, respira hondo, mientras te lo escondo
Contigo, obligado, hoy yo me pongo el cond√≥n
Pero porque voy a media cancha, baby, como Rondo

Yo a ti te doy una sepultura dura
Yo s√© que con el tiempo la herida se cura
Es que en verdad es que t√∫ no est√°' a esa altura
Te lo juro por Dios, aunque por Dios no se jura

(Casper)

Pa'l carajo te bot√©
Yo sin ti me siento bien
Ya no sufro por amores, ahora rompo corazones
Y sobran las pacas de cien (sobran las pacas de cien)

T√∫ me rompiste el coraz√≥n (t√∫ me rompiste el coraz√≥n)
Sin sentido y sin raz√≥n (sin sentido y sin raz√≥n)
Pero tengo un culo nuevo que me da mucho cari√±o
Y me chinga bien cabr√≥n (bien cabr√≥n)

No te lo voy a negar que te sufr√≠, la pas√© mal

Preguntando a d√≥nde fue

Pero tu amiga me textea
Siempre que ella me desea
Se tira una foto conmigo
Y me dice pa' que t√∫ la vea'

Prendo pa' ver si me olvido
De tu nombre, tus besos, tu cuerpo, tus gemidos
Lo hac√≠amos en el carro, me gritaba al o√≠do
Cierro los ojos y pienso en todo lo que hicimos, baby

Prendo pa' ver si me olvido
De tu nombre, tus besos, tu cuerpo, tus gemidos
Lo hac√≠amos en el carro, me gritaba al o√≠do
Cierro los ojos y pienso en todo lo que hicimos, baby (Nio)

Yo te di confianza y me fallaste
Te burlaste de m√≠ y me humillaste
Me gusta que te fuiste y no explicaste
Viste mi pel√≠cula y viraste

Ahora quieres saber lo que pienso de ti
Me siento cabr√≥n porque no est√°s aqu√≠

Miento si digo que no me hace falta
Cuando me rozaba tu piel
Miento si digo que no me hace falta
Que llames al amanecer
Pidi√©ndome que te agarre bien dura
En la cama y te haga mi mujer
Aprovecho el remix con Ozu
Para mandarte pa'l carajo tambi√©n

No quiero mentira' ni tu falsedad
Me voy pa' la calle esta noche a rumbiar
Me bebo dos tragos y te voy a olvidar
Me voy con las baby' que quieran jugar

91,41,"River (feat. Ed Sheeran)","Eminem",2018,69332072,"I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run
He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jetpack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said ""Bye Suzanne""
After the first night, but tonight I am
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat

A one-night stand turned a two-night stand
It was ""come sunlight, scram, "" now we hug tight, and
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit (Fuck!)
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain

River (ooh), river run
Call me (ooh), call me (ooh)
River (ooh), we'll let the river run
Always the bridesmaid, never ""The bride, hey!""
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me

He had two of his kids with him right in the studio, that's when I knew
You a stand up nigga, I love seein' shit like that

I been playing it back from a lack of promotions
I was never one for the bragging and boasting
I guess I was hoping the music would speak for itself, but the people want everything else
Ok, no problem, I‚Äôll show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I'm batting a thousand
It‚Äôs got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
He call it ""a lot,"" I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
‚ÄôFlectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
Dennis Smith, Jr. stay solid, my nigga
I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
When they thought that I wasn't gone pan out, I got a plan
They say that success is the greatest revenge, tell all your friends
Cole on a mission, cementin' the spot as the greatest that did it

I fought through it all, but that shit hurt me severely
I've been gettin' high to hide behind my insecurities
Takin' different pills but I know it ain't gon'

I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?

Homicides when we lurk, I'ma step 'til my feet hurt
Been puttin' them streets first
White tees turned burgundy T-shirts
Lookin' for somethin' real, he stuck in a deep search
Anxiety killin' me, I just wanna leave Earth
When they ask if I'm okay, it just make everything seem worse
Tryna explain your feelings sound like something you rehearsed
Stabbed me in my back with a clean smirk
Lookin' so deep into your eyes, I can read your thoughts, so
Shut the fuck, I mean, please don't talk
I done been through too much and I don't need another loss
Put that on every war scar, for every battle I fought
